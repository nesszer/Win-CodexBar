# ADR 0005: Hosted PR check moves to CircleCI Windows

Date: 2026-08-30
Status: Accepted; supersedes the hosted-runner decision of ADR 0001 and the
Blacksmith gate description in ADR 0002

## Context

The shared Blacksmith free-tier minute pool is exhausted, so the Blacksmith
GitHub Actions runners behind ADR 0001's PR check
(`.github/workflows/pr-check.yml`) can no longer be relied on for scheduled
PR validation. CircleCI is already this repo's hosted Windows platform for
releases (ADR 0004), with a working `circleci/windows@5.0` configuration, and
the repository is public, so its PR builds draw on CircleCI's Free Plan
open-source allowance rather than the personal credit block.

## Decision

Move the hosted PR/push gate to CircleCI as a new `pr-check` job in
`.circleci/config.yml` (workflow `pr-check`):

- `win/default` executor, `size: medium`. The check steps are not re-declared
  in the config: the provisioning and gate logic is extracted into scripts
  that the config calls, and the whole check delegates to
  `scripts/local-check.ps1 -Slice ci`, an opt-in slice that mirrors
  `.github/workflows/pr-check.yml` step for step (`cargo fmt --all --check`,
  `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test
  --workspace`, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm run
  build`, plus the interaction-guard script tests). The script's default
  (no-parameter) local behavior is unchanged.
  - `scripts/circleci-pr-gates.ps1` owns the three skip decisions that used
    to live inline in the config (budget `off`, non-PR branch pushes other
    than main/master and `gh-readonly-queue/` merge-queue pushes, docs-only PR
    diffs); each true skip calls `circleci-agent step
    halt`.
  - `scripts/run-circleci-pr-check.ps1` owns toolchain provisioning with
    official checksum verification: `rustup-init.exe` is downloaded from
    static.rust-lang.org and verified against the official adjacent
    `.sha256` file; the Node 24.18.0 x64 MSI is verified against the
    official `SHASUMS256.txt` entry before `msiexec` runs (into a dedicated
    per-version `INSTALLDIR`, because a same-product MSI upgrade silently
    no-ops); pnpm is activated by corepack from the exact `packageManager`
    pin in `apps/desktop-tauri/package.json`.
  - Pure checksum/gate logic lives in `scripts/circleci-pr-common.ps1` and
    is exercised offline by `scripts/circleci-pr.tests.ps1`.
  - The pinned Rust version is read from
    `scripts/circleci-pinned-rust.txt`; the Cargo target cache keys embed
    `{{ checksum "scripts/circleci-pinned-rust.txt" }}` so a Rust pin bump
    invalidates the target cache (no pipeline parameter, no config edit).
  - The config depends on compile-time GitHub App PR pipeline values:
    `pipeline.event.context.github.pr_url` and
    `pipeline.event.github.pull_request.base.sha` (populated only on pull
    request events; empty on push pipelines). They come from CircleCI's
    GitHub App integration, so fork-PR pipelines are never built and a
    manual same-repo branch fallback is needed for external contributors'
    changes.
- Trigger: the workflow filter stays wide (`branches: only: /.*/`) because
  CircleCI delivers same-repo PR builds as branch pipelines; parity with the
  GitHub workflow (PRs plus pushes to `main`/`master`, `paths-ignore` for
  `docs/**`, `**/*.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `.github/CI.md`) is enforced inside the
  job by early gates. Each true skip condition logs its reason and then calls
  `circleci-agent step halt`, which stops the entire job — before the cache
  restore steps and the fused provision/run step — so a skip spends no cache
  or toolchain minutes (the throw on a non-zero `circleci-agent` exit code
  prevents a silent no-op). Docs-only detection diffs the base commit
  against the head with a two-dot tree diff (robust when the base is fetched
  at depth 1): on PRs the base SHA comes primarily from the compile-time
  GitHub App pipeline value `pipeline.event.github.pull_request.base.sha`
  (populated on pull request events); if that is empty while the pipeline is
  still PR-associated, the base SHA is resolved from the public GitHub pulls
  API using the documented `CIRCLE_PROJECT_USERNAME`/`CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME`
  variables and fetched with `--depth=1`. Docs-only evaluation applies only
  to PR-associated pipelines; every `main`/`master` push and every
  `gh-readonly-queue/` merge-queue push runs the full checks. Any resolution, fetch, or diff failure on a PR pipeline fails
  open: it exits only the gate step and therefore continues the job
  into the checks; the gate never silently skips on an unknown base.
- Budget gating stays honest and coarse: the job reads `CI_BUDGET_MODE` as a
  CircleCI project environment variable (unset/empty = `normal`) and halts
  the job via `circleci-agent step halt` when it equals `off`.

`.github/workflows/pr-check.yml` is retained as a manual-dispatch-only
fallback: its `on:` block now holds `workflow_dispatch` only (push and
`pull_request` triggers removed), so it no longer schedules automatically and
can be run by hand for Blacksmith diagnostics with the job body intact. The
interaction guard (`.github/workflows/interaction-guard.yml`) remains a
GitHub Actions workflow and is unaffected.

## Consequences

- Auto-cancel of superseded pushes is a CircleCI **project setting**
  ("Auto-cancel redundant workflows", Project Settings → Advanced), keyed by
  branch the same way the GitHub workflow's `concurrency` group was; the
  `pr-check` job carries no `concurrency` YAML.
- Hosted PR feedback continues on the real Windows target with no Blacksmith
  dependency.
- `CI_BUDGET_MODE` must now be set in two places to control both surfaces:
  CircleCI project environment variables (read by the `pr-check` guard) and
  GitHub Actions repository variables (read by `vars.CI_BUDGET_MODE`). The
  glossary in `CONTEXT.md` documents both.
- CircleCI Windows credits become the recurring PR cost, spent against the
  open-source allowance; organization credit alerts should cover the PR check
  as well as releases.
- ADRs 0001 and 0002 remain as immutable history describing the Blacksmith
  era; this ADR supersedes only where the hosted PR check runs.
