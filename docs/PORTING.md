# Upstream port procedure (Windows)

How **Win-CodexBar** tracks and ports releases from upstream
[`steipete/CodexBar`](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar). This is a Windows
rewrite (Rust + Tauri), not a Swift fork — treat upstream as a **behavior and
wire-shape source**, not code to cherry-pick.

## Sync baseline

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| Upstream repo | `steipete/CodexBar` |
| Last landed baseline | **v0.55.0** (`061593c`) |
| Current port base | `main` at Win-CodexBar **0.55.0** |
| Canonical PR | One final PR per upstream release: `Port upstream CodexBar X.Y.Z` |
| Review topology | Behavioral micro PRs -> release integration branch -> canonical PR -> `main` |

Version bumps of *this* repo are a **separate later step**. A port PR lands
behavior; it does not have to ship a release tag.

## Zero upstream contact

- Do **not** open issues or PRs against `steipete/CodexBar`.
- Do **not** ping upstream maintainers about port status.
- Consume public release notes, compare API, and tagged sources only.

---

## Procedure

### 1. Detect the delta

1. Read the upstream GitHub release notes for `v<new>`.
2. Diff tags with the compare API (pin both ends — never `main`):

```powershell
# Example: 0.46.0 → 0.47.0
$prev = 'v0.46.0'
$new  = 'v0.47.0'
Invoke-RestMethod "https://api.github.com/repos/steipete/CodexBar/compare/$prev...$new" |
  Select-Object -ExpandProperty files |
  Select-Object status, filename |
  Format-Table -AutoSize
```

3. **Pin every source read to the release tag**, e.g.

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steipete/CodexBar/v0.47.0/path/to/File.swift
```

Never use `main` / default-branch raw URLs for port work — they drift under you.

### 2. Classify every release-note item

For each bullet / merged PR in the release, assign exactly one class:

| Class | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **PORT** | Has a local counterpart (provider, settings path, CLI, UI surface, fixture). |
| **SKIP** | macOS-exclusive or no Windows analog. Common skips: Keychain, iCloud/CloudKit, AppKit/SwiftUI menu chrome, `libproc`, `0600` POSIX file modes (our `secure_file` + DPAPI already covers owner-only intent). |
| **DECIDE-by-audit** | Unclear. Needs evidence before coding (see below). |

**DECIDE-by-audit evidence** (collect before touching code):

- Upstream file paths + symbols at the **tagged** revision
- Local counterpart path (or explicit “none”)
- Wire shape / fixture sample if network or file format is involved
- UI surface impact (tray / settings tab / float bar / none)
- Proposed class: PORT, SKIP, or **DEFER-with-evidence**

When the upstream reference is ambiguous, prefer **DEFER-with-evidence** over a
guess-port. Example from the 0.47.0 pass: Claude cold-boot items
(`#2493` / `#2494`) were deferred — not portable as written, not silently
half-implemented.

### 3. Split into behavioral micro PRs

Prefer many small review PRs, but stop at a complete behavioral boundary. A micro
PR should be independently understandable, testable, and revertible. Do not split
a parser, its fixture, and its regression test into separate ceremonial PRs.

For upstream `X.Y.Z`:

1. Create a release integration branch: `port/upstream-X.Y.Z`.
2. Create each workstream on `port/micro-X.Y.Z-<slug>` and open that PR **into
   `port/upstream-X.Y.Z`**, not `main`.
3. One provider or one vertical feature per micro PR when practical. Include the
   implementation, fixtures, tests, and directly required shared plumbing in the
   same review unit.
4. Shared infrastructure used by several workstreams can be its own micro PR when
   that makes later PRs smaller and independently reviewable.
5. Merge reviewed micro PRs into the release integration branch. Do **not** open
   the canonical PR to `main` until the release audit is complete and the branch
   is ready for full integration validation.
6. Open one canonical `Port upstream CodexBar X.Y.Z` PR from
   `port/upstream-X.Y.Z` to `main`. It should contain no surprise work; its job is
   to prove the release-wide PORT / SKIP / DEFER audit and integration result.
7. Keep SKIP / DEFER notes in that canonical PR body. Do not open empty stub
   modules "for later".

#### CI budget rule for micro PRs

Hosted CI and review granularity are intentionally different:

- Micro PRs targeting `port/upstream-*` are filtered out at CircleCI workflow
  compilation time, before Windows compute starts. The decision uses the PR base/target
  branch, not the head-branch name; a `port/micro-*` head opened directly to `main`
  still receives the full hosted gate. Their required evidence is focused local tests
  plus any broader local gate justified by the change.
- High-risk Windows-native micro PRs may use the manual Blacksmith backup workflow
  as a deliberate second opinion, but it is not automatic.
- The canonical `port/upstream-X.Y.Z` -> `main` PR receives the full CircleCI
  Windows gate. Run full local checks, CUA for UI-affecting work, and thermo review
  before relying on hosted CI.
- CircleCI Project Settings should have **Auto-cancel redundant workflows** enabled
  so superseded non-default-branch runs stop consuming credits.
- Do not use `[skip ci]` to bypass the canonical release PR gate.

### 4. Port fixtures from exact wire shapes

- Copy field names, enums, and JSON shapes from upstream’s tagged sources or
  captured responses.
- **Never invent** upstream field names to make a test green.
- Prefer checked-in fixtures under the provider’s test tree; keep redaction of
  secrets.

### 5. Per-provider recipe

New or materially changed provider — touch the full registration path:

1. Provider module — `rust/src/providers/<name>/` (parse, auth, `fetch_usage`)
2. `ProviderId` — `rust/src/core/provider/id.rs`, plus its row in `rust/src/core/provider/spec.rs` (`cli_name`, display, cookie domain, …)
3. Factory arm — `rust/src/core/provider_factory.rs` (exhaustive match)
4. Token accounts / multi-account plumbing if the provider uses it
5. Frontend catalog — `providerIcons` / `providerCatalog` (and any settings
   detail UI)
6. `provider_settings` / settings schema as needed
7. Locale keys in the **existing catalog style** (machine-translated values OK)

Worked example on this branch:

- Notion AI — commit `4774d64a` (`Port upstream 0.47.0: Notion AI provider`)
- xAI — commit `c05d48df` (`Port upstream 0.47.0: XAI provider`)

Also see [PROVIDERS.md](./PROVIDERS.md).

### 6. CUA proof rule (UI-affecting ports)

Unit tests and `local-check` do **not** prove tray, settings chrome, float bar,
theme, or WebView2 behavior.

If the port changes any of those surfaces:

1. Fresh local rebuild of the desktop binary
2. Proof mode as needed (`CODEXBAR_PROOF_MODE`, e.g. `settings:providers`)
3. Drive with **CUA Driver** ([trycua/cua](https://github.com/trycua/cua));
   attach screenshots / notes to the PR
4. If CUA cannot run, say why and attach equivalent manual proof

Details: root [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) (Testing & QA) and the PR template.

### 7. Gate before review

For every micro PR, run the focused tests that prove its behavior. Add broader local
checks when the work touches shared infrastructure, account state, persistence, or
Windows-native behavior.

```powershell
# Focused provider / parser examples
cargo test -p codexbar notion
cargo test -p codexbar xai

# CLI smoke examples
cargo run -p codexbar -- usage -p notion -v
cargo run -p codexbar -- config providers
```

Before opening the canonical release PR to `main`, run the full local mirror:

```powershell
.\scripts\local-check.ps1 -Slice ci
```

Run the normal developer gate as well when the host supports its shell-dependent
checks. UI-affecting work requires CUA (or documented equivalent manual proof).

### 8. PR body and follow-ups

PR title: `Port upstream CodexBar X.Y.Z`.

Body must list:

- **Ported** — item + short note / commit
- **Skipped** — item + reason (macOS-only, no counterpart, …)
- **Deferred** — item + evidence pointer (issue-style notes OK inside the PR)

Do **not** mix the Win-CodexBar version bump / changelog release cut into the
port PR unless that is an explicit separate decision. Port first; release later.

## Conventions

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| No upstream interaction | No issues/PRs/comments on `steipete/CodexBar` |
| Review scope | One complete behavior per micro PR; branch `port/micro-X.Y.Z-<slug>` |
| Canonical scope | One release-wide PR from `port/upstream-X.Y.Z` to `main` |
| Commit scope | One workstream per commit; message prefix `Port upstream X.Y.Z: ...` |
| Hosted CI | Micro branches skip automatic CircleCI; canonical release PR gets full CircleCI; Blacksmith is manual reserve |
| Source pin | Always `vX.Y.Z` tag URLs / compare range — never `main` |
| Locales | Add keys in existing catalog style; machine translation allowed |
| Ambiguity | **DEFER-with-evidence** > guess-port |
| Secrets | DPAPI / `secure_file` for owner-only data; do not reimplement Keychain |
| POSIX mode bits | SKIP — owner-only intent already covered on Windows |
| Stubs | No empty “coming soon” provider shells for SKIP items |

Baseline: upstream **v0.46.0** @ `e53abbeb`. Branch: `port/upstream-0.47.0`.

### Ported

| Item | Notes |
|------|--------|
| Notion AI provider | Full recipe; commit `4774d64a` |
| XAI provider | Full recipe; commit `c05d48df` |
| Hooks watch | `codexbar hooks watch` (#2536); commit `6495db74` |

| Real-calendar monthly pace | #2552; commit `acb9c44f` |
| z.ai / Kimi / Grok window durations | #2431; commit `7cbcc775` |

### Skipped

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| iCloud sync | CloudKit / macOS account surface — no counterpart |
| Keychain work | macOS Keychain; Windows uses DPAPI + `secure_file` |
| `libproc` usage | macOS process APIs |
| Menu SwiftUI churn | AppKit/SwiftUI menu bar — different shell (Tauri tray) |
| z.ai charts | No local chart counterpart for that change set |
| CurrencyExchange | No local counterpart |
| W5 | No local counterpart |
| W7 | No local counterpart |

### Deferred (not portable as written)

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Claude #2493 / #2494 (cold-boot) | DEFER-with-evidence — upstream behavior tied to macOS lifecycle / paths that do not map cleanly; do not guess-port |

---

## Appendix — Worked example: upstream 0.49.0–0.53.0

Baseline: upstream **v0.46.0** @ `e53abbeb` → **v0.53.0**. PRs #337–#346.

### Ported

| Upstream | PR | Items |
|----------|-----|-------|
| 0.49.0 | #337 | Provider parity, settings schema updates |
| 0.50.0 | #338 | Provider usage parsing fixes |
| 0.51.0 | #339 | Billing/usage wire-shape updates |
| 0.52.0 | #341, #344, #346 | TOON provider, gRPC-web/proto billing, UsageSourceSection changes |
| 0.53.0 | #341, #344, #346 | Locale parity, billing internals, deferred items |

Bug fixes landed alongside the ports: #333, #334, #335, #336, #342, #343.

### Skipped

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| iCloud sync | CloudKit / macOS — no Windows counterpart |
| Keychain work | macOS Keychain; Windows uses DPAPI + `secure_file` |
| `libproc` usage | macOS process APIs |
| Menu SwiftUI churn | AppKit/SwiftUI menu bar — different shell (Tauri tray) |

### Deferred (not portable as written)

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Full upstream 0.53 locale parity (all 23 languages) | Only `en-US` ported; full 23-language catalog is a follow-up |
| TOON v4.1 spec conformance depth | Basic provider ported; full spec compliance deferred pending upstream stabilization |
| Grok gRPC-web+proto billing internals | Wire shape captured; deep proto decoding deferred |
| Codex fork-accounting timezone audit | Upstream timezone handling needs evidence before porting |
| UsageSourceSection backend-driven options | `GrokUsageSourceSection` renamed but still hardcodes options — backend-driven enumeration deferred |
